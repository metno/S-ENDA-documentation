# Use cases for S-ENDA
Use case descriptions for the S-ENDA project

# Conventions

* master branch: only for complete use case descriptions. Corrections/changes are handled in hotfix
  branches, and must be reviewed before merging
* issue branches: 

    * ideas for new use cases should be described in regular issues (at
      https://github.com/metno/use-cases-for-S-ENDA/issues). They can be simple one line, or more
      elaborate, descriptions

    * for each issue, we create issue branches in which the respective issue is solved and reviewed

The master branch will be linked from readthedocs (and/or similar), and shall be complete, nice and
understandable - i.e., so it does not give the impression that it is half-done work...
