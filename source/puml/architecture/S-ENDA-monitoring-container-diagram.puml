The API requires input metadata on a required format, and provides metadata validators (e.g., for MMD). Also contains various storage and search solutions for discovery metadata. The event queue maintains history for allowing temporarily failing subscribers to catch up.")

GHC can be used to monitor overall health of OGC services (OWS) like WMS, WFS, WCS, WMTS, SOS, CSW and more, plus some recent OGC APIs like SensorThings API and WFS v3 (OGC Features API).
